        //Challenge #375 [Easy] Print a new number by adding one to each of its digit

        //Description
        //A number is input in computer then a new no should get printed by adding one to each of its digit.
        //If you encounter a 9, insert a 10(don't carry over, just shift things around).
       

        //For example, 998 becomes 10109.
       
       //Bonus
       //This challenge is trivial to do if you map it to a string to iterate over the input, operate, and then cast it back.
       // Instead, try doing it without casting it as a string at any point, keep it numeric(int, float if you need it) only.
